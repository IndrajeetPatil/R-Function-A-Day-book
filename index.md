# About {-}

A book that collects (and provides an easy way to access and search) tweets from *R Function A Day* [account](https://twitter.com/rfunctionaday) that I created and maintained as a hobby project for 1 year (from **24.01.2021** to **24.01.2022**).

There are 365 posts^[Actually, there are 366 posts to be exact. But I accidentally wrote about one function on two separate occasion, so I count them as one post. It's a fun game to find which one üòâ] in this book, one for each day.

Since the tweets are embedded, the web browser will be slow to load them. So please be patient.
Apologies for these performance issues.
