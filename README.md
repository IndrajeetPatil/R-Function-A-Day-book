Welcome! 

A book that collects (and provides an easy way to access and search) tweets from *R Function A Day* [account](https://twitter.com/rfunctionaday) that I created and maintained as a hobby project for 1 year (from **24.01.2021** to **24.01.2022**).

Since the tweets are embedded, the web browser will be slow to load them. So please be patient.
Apologies for these performance issues.
